              <h2>Why this matters commercially</h2>
              <p>
                When learning does not translate into capability, organisations lose more than training
                budget. They lose time, student momentum, manager confidence and the opportunity to build
                stronger teams.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: 12 }}>
                For regulated financial services organisations, capability gaps can also affect client
                experience, compliance confidence, sales performance and progression planning.
              </p>
              <p style={{ marginTop: 12 }}>
                CPS helps reduce that risk by managing the full learning journey, from programme alignment
                to student progress, support, completion and measurement.
